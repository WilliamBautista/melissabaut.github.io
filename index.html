              <p class="paper_text">In the Fall Semester of 2023, I completed the Consulting Cup Challenge as a semi-finalist at Fordham University. My peers and I were tasked as a consulting to group to analyze Costco Wholesale and its operations to pose a solution to an identified challenge the firm has been facing. Our final written report responds to the identified challenge with an implementation method in order to solve the issue. Attached is a sample of my contribution included in the final report that contains an overview of the market and firm.</p>

            <p class="paper_text">This piece I wrote in my spring semester of 2023. I was nominated by my Composition professor to be published in Rhētorikós: Excellence in Student Writing. Rhētorikós is an online journal of academic composed in Fordham University’s core writing classes (Composition I and II). In this essay, I discuss the barriers introverted personalities face from youth to adulthood and how society disregards these challenges. Attached is a sample of my work that will be published in the Spring Journal of Rhētorikós. </p>
